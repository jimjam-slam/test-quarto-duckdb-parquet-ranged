# test-quarto-duckdb-parquet-ranged
Quick test to see if Quarto can use ranged HTTP requests when querying a Parquet file.

[ACORN-SAT](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat) data is from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au). It is not covered by this repo's MIT licence. 

`acorn.r`: package ACORN-SAT 2.3 files into a Parquet file.

`index.qmd`: test to see if the Parquet file is accessed using HTTP ranged requests when accessed with the Observable DuckDB client.
  - The doc has been updated to pull the file directly from GitHub rather than locally, but it's still not working. It does look like DuckDB-WASM has the ability to do ranged requests, though, so this is likely a case of bad headers from the server. Will play around more!
